The core function of ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) is to store and release energy for essential biochemical reactions. ADP is a molecule that is involved in transferring and providing cells with energy. It plays a crucial role in providing energy for muscle contraction, firing neurons, and intracellular signaling. ADP is also involved in blood clotting and wound healing, and it enhances platelet function.

ATP is used to power cellular processes, and its energy is released when it is broken down to ADP. The energy stored in the phosphate bonds of ADP is less than that of ATP, but it is still an important intermediate in energy metabolism.

In addition to its role in energy metabolism, ADP is also involved in other biological processes, such as photosynthesis and glycolysis. In photosynthesis, ADP is used to store energy from light, which is then used to synthesize glucose. In glycolysis, ADP is used to break down glucose and produce ATP.
