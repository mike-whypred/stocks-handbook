## 1. What is CSX?

#### 1.1 What is the History of CSX?

The history of CSX Corporation dates back to 1980, when it was formed as a result of the merger between Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries. The company was established on November 1, 1980, and was initially headquartered in Richmond, Virginia.

The name "CSX" was chosen during the merger talks between Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries. The company chairmen, Prime F. Osborn III and Hays T. Watkins Jr., wanted a name that would not include either of the two companies' names, as it was a partnership. Employees were asked for suggestions, and most of them consisted of combinations of the initials "C" and "S". The lawyers decided to use "CSX" as a temporary shorthand name, and it eventually stuck.

The "X" in CSX was initially intended to have no meaning, but it was later explained that it stood for "Consolidated". The company's logo features a stylized letter "X" that is formed by combining the letters "C" and "S".
