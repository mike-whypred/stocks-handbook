DoorDash contributes to the gig economy by providing a platform for independent contractors, known as Dashers, to work on their own schedule and choose their own hours.

DoorDash provides a suite of software tools to help Dashers manage their work, including real-time traffic updates, live support, and geo-optimized delivery requests.

DoorDash's business model is based on a gig economy model, where workers are paid per delivery or booking, rather than an hourly wage. This model allows DoorDash to avoid providing benefits and protections to its workers, such as minimum wage, sick leave, and workers' compensation.

However, DoorDash's recent move to offer an hourly wage option for its drivers has raised concerns that it may be trying to reclassify its workers as employees, which could have significant implications for the gig economy model. Some experts argue that this move could be seen as a attempt to exert more control over workers and potentially lead to a reclassification of workers as employees.

Overall, DoorDash's contribution to the gig economy is to provide a platform for independent contractors to work on their own terms, while also allowing the company to avoid providing benefits and protections to its workers.
