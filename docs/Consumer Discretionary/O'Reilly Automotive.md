## 1. What is O'Reilly Automotive?

#### 1.1 What is the History of O'Reilly Automotive?

The history of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. dates back to 1849 when Michael Byrne O'Reilly immigrated to America from Ireland. He settled in St. Louis and worked his way through school to earn a law degree, then pursued a career as a title examiner. His son, Charles Francis O'Reilly, attended college in St. Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St. Louis.

By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. He recognized the region as an area of growth and opportunity and asked to be transferred there. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield, and one of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) O'Reilly, joined the company. Together they helped make Link Motor Supply the predominant auto parts store in the area.

In 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. O'Reilly, and the transfer of Chub O'Reilly to Kansas City. The two made the decision to form their own company, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. They opened for business in Springfield, Missouri on December 2, 1957, with one store and 13 employees. Their sales totaled $700,000 in 1958â€”their first full year of business.

By 1961, the company's volume had reached $1.3 million in combined sales volume of O'Reilly Automotive and their Ozark Automotive Distributors, a division formed to serve independent automotive jobbers in the area. In March 1975, annual sales volume rose to $7 million and a 52,000 square-foot facility was built for the O'Reilly/Ozark warehouse operation. By that time, the company had nine stores, all located in southwestern Missouri.

The company continued to grow and expand, and in 1993, it completed an initial public stock offering, trading on the NASDAQ market under the symbol ORLY. Today, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. operates more than 6,131 stores in 48 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada, and is the dominant auto parts retailer in all of its market areas.

Throughout its history, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. has been committed to its core values of honesty, integrity, and hard work, and has been recognized for its commitment to its employees, customers, and the communities it serves.
