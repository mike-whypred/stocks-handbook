## 1. What is Starbucks?

#### 1.1 How was Starbucks Founded?

Starbucks was founded on March 30, 1971, by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker in Seattle, Washington, USA. The three friends, who met while studying at the University of San Francisco, were passionate about coffee and wanted to bring high-quality coffee beans to Seattle. They invested $1,350 each and borrowed $5,000 from a bank to start the business.

The first Starbucks store was located at Pike Place Market in Seattle and was initially a small, 1,000-square-foot mercantile space that sold whole-bean coffee, tea, and spices. The store was named after the character Starbuck from Herman Melville's novel "Moby-Dick," which was chosen because it sounded unique and memorable.

In the early years, Starbucks focused on selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment, and the store became a popular destination for coffee enthusiasts. However, the founders soon realized that there was a demand for espresso-based drinks, and they began to experiment with espresso machines.

In 1982, Howard Schultz, who was then the company's director of marketing, was inspired by the Italian coffee culture during a trip to Italy. He returned to Seattle and convinced the founders to test the concept of espresso-based drinks in their stores. The experiment was successful, and Schultz was promoted to president and COO of the company in 1986.

Under Schultz's leadership, Starbucks expanded rapidly, and the company went public in 1992.
