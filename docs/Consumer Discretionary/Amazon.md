## 1. What is Amazon?

#### 1.1 How did Amazon Start?

Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos as an online bookstore called Cadabra, Inc. However, the name was later changed to Amazon.com, Inc. in 1995 due to the similarity of "Cadabra" to "cadaver." Bezos started the company in his garage in Bellevue, Washington, and initially sold books online. The first book ever sold on Amazon was "Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought" by Douglas R. Hofstadter.

In the early days, Amazon's operations were simple, with a team of just a few people working out of Bezos' garage. The company's first warehouse was located in Seattle, and employees would pick and pack orders by walking through rows of shelves with flatbed carts. The company's early success was fueled by its ability to offer a wide selection of books at competitive prices, as well as its innovative approach to customer service.

In 1997, Amazon expanded its product line beyond books to include CDs, videos, and software. The company went public in 1997, raising $54 million in its initial public offering (IPO). This influx of capital allowed Amazon to expand its operations and invest in new technologies, such as its 1-Click ordering system.

In the early 2000s, Amazon began to expand its product line further, adding electronics, toys, and clothing to its offerings. The company also launched its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service, which allowed third-party sellers to store and ship their products from Amazon's warehouses.

In 2005, Amazon launched its Prime membership program, which offered customers free two-day shipping and other benefits. The program was a huge success, and Amazon has since expanded it to include additional benefits, such as streaming of music and video content.

Today, Amazon is one of the world's largest and most successful companies, with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. The company has expanded its product line to include a wide range of goods and services, and has launched new businesses such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides cloud computing services to businesses and individuals.

Amazon's success can be attributed to its innovative approach to business, its focus on customer service, and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions.
