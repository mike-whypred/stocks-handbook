Books are cataloged and classified in book holdings using various systems, including the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) system and the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system. Here's an overview of how books are cataloged and classified:

1. **Library of Congress Classification (LCC) System**: This system is used in most college and university libraries. It divides knowledge into 21 broad subject areas, each represented by a letter of the alphabet. Books are shelved according to their call numbers, which are a combination of letters and numbers that indicate the subject area and the specific book's location on the shelf.
2. **Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) System**: This system is used in school, public, and small libraries. It divides knowledge into 10 main classes, each represented by a number from 000 to 999. Books are shelved according to their call numbers, which are a combination of numbers and letters that indicate the subject area and the specific book's location on the shelf.
3. **Cataloging**: Cataloging is the process of creating and maintaining bibliographic and authority records in the library catalog. It involves three major activities: descriptive cataloging, subject cataloging, and authority control. Descriptive cataloging involves recording the attributes of a library item, such as the author's name, title, publisher, and date. Subject cataloging involves assigning subject headings and classification numbers to the book. Authority control involves maintaining the accuracy of author and subject headings.
4. **Collection Types**: Libraries may have different collection types, such as audiobooks, big books, biographies, eBooks, and emerging readers. Each collection type has its own specific call number prefix and classification system.
5. **Shelving**: Books are shelved according to their call numbers, which are a combination of letters and numbers that indicate the subject area and the specific book's location on the shelf. Books are arranged in alphabetical order by author's last name, and then by title.
6. **Browsing**: Libraries allow users to browse the shelves to find books that are related to a specific subject or topic. This is done by looking at the call numbers and subject headings on the books.
7. **Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC)**: Many libraries use an OPAC to provide online access to their catalog. Users can search the catalog by author, title, subject, or keyword, and retrieve information about the book, including its call number and location.

In summary, books are cataloged and classified using various systems, including the Library of Congress Classification system and the Dewey Decimal Classification system. Cataloging involves creating and maintaining bibliographic and authority records, and books are shelved according to their call numbers. Libraries may have different collection types, and users can browse the shelves to find books that are related to a specific subject or topic.
