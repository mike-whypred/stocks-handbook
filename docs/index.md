# Welcome to StockBook

StockBook is an intelligence gathering project to create an AI generated knowledge base for industy research on listed stocks. It addresses some of the challenges raised the in Stanford [STORM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) paper around the requirement of thorough research and pre-planning before topic specific writing can be conducted. This approach is laborious, research intensive and expensive for humans to conduct, however it is an area that AI excels in. The knowledge base articles in StockBook are generated using an AI research agent, Thoth AI. Thoth was conceived independently of STORM around about the same time period.

Investing is one area where human analyst are required to sift through large amounts of information to distill insight. AI can be used to automate information collection, knowledge synthesis and improve productivity.
