## 1. What is Moderna?

#### 1.1 What is the Background and History of Moderna?

Moderna, Inc. is a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company that focuses on RNA therapeutics, primarily mRNA vaccines. The company was founded in 2010 by Derrick Rossi, Timothy A. Springer, Kenneth R. Chien, Robert S. Langer, and Noubar Afeyan. St√©phane Bancel, the current CEO, was appointed as CEO in 2011.

Moderna's name combines the words "modified" and "RNA", which happens to contain the word "modern." The company's mission is to change the world and make mRNA medicines a reality for humanity.

Moderna's early years were marked by significant milestones, including the formation of partnerships with AstraZeneca, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and Merck & Co. to develop treatments for various diseases. The company also received grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop mRNA vaccines.

In 2015, Moderna initiated its first human dose of an mRNA vaccine, an H10N8 flu vaccine candidate. The company also launched its first venture, Onkaido Therapeutics, to focus on developing mRNA-based oncology treatments.

In 2018, Moderna became a public company via the largest initial public offering of a biotechnology company in history, raising $621 million by selling 27 million shares at $23 per share.

Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, was developed in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was the first vaccine to be shipped for testing against the novel coronavirus. The vaccine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020 and has been widely distributed and administered around the world.

Today, Moderna is a leading player in the biotechnology industry, with a market capitalization of over $28 billion and a pipeline of mRNA-based drugs in development for various diseases, including infectious diseases, oncology, cardiovascular diseases, and rare genetic diseases.

#### 1.2 How Does Moderna's mRNA Technology Work?

Moderna's mRNA technology works by using messenger RNA (mRNA) to teach the body how to make a specific protein that can help prevent or treat certain diseases. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Design**: Scientists design an mRNA that carries instructions for a specific protein.
2. **Synthesis**: The mRNA is synthesized in the laboratory using a proprietary process.
3. **Lipid wrapping**: The mRNA is wrapped in lipids, or fats, to protect it from degradation and help it enter cells.
4. **Delivery**: The mRNA-lipid complex is delivered to the body through an injection or infusion.
5. **Cell entry**: The mRNA-lipid complex enters cells, where it is released from the lipid wrapping.
6. **Translation**: The mRNA is translated into a specific protein by the cell's ribosomes.
7. **Immune response**: The protein is recognized by the immune system as foreign, triggering an immune response.
8. **Antibody production**: The immune system produces antibodies that recognize and bind to the protein, providing immunity against future infections.

Moderna's mRNA platform is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for the rapid development and production of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. The company's technology has been used to develop vaccines against COVID-19, as well as therapeutics for other diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders.

It's worth noting that mRNA vaccines do not contain live or attenuated viruses, and they do not enter the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is kept. Instead, the mRNA is translated into a protein that is recognized by the immune system, triggering an immune response.

What sets Moderna apart from traditional vaccine development is the use of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine that uses a piece of genetic material, called messenger RNA, to instruct cells in the body to produce a specific protein. This protein is then recognized by the immune system as foreign, triggering an immune response.

Moderna's mRNA vaccine technology is different from traditional vaccines in several ways:

1. **Faster development**: mRNA vaccines can be developed much faster than traditional vaccines, which can take months or even years to produce. mRNA vaccines can be constructed quickly using only the pathogen's genetic code.
2. **No need for weakened virus**: mRNA vaccines do not require the use of a weakened virus, which can be time-consuming and difficult to produce.
3. **Direct delivery**: mRNA vaccines can be delivered directly to the cells of the body, where they can be translated into protein, rather than relying on the immune system to recognize and respond to the virus.
4. **Improved safety**: mRNA vaccines have a good safety profile, as they do not integrate into the host genome and have a short half-life in the body.
5. **Flexibility**: mRNA vaccines can be easily modified to target different strains of a virus, making them a promising approach for addressing emerging infectious diseases.
6. **Potential for multiple doses**: mRNA vaccines can be designed to provide long-term immunity, potentially reducing the need for multiple doses.
7. **Potential for combination therapy**: mRNA vaccines can be combined with other therapies, such as antibodies, to provide a more comprehensive approach to disease treatment.

Moderna's mRNA vaccine technology has shown promising results in clinical trials, with both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines demonstrating high efficacy and safety profiles. The company's mRNA vaccine technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of vaccine development and provide a new approach to preventing and treating infectious diseases.
