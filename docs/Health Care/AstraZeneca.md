## 1. What is AstraZeneca?

#### 1.1 What is the History and Background of AstraZeneca?

AstraZeneca was formed in 1999 through the merger of the Swedish Astra AB and the British Zeneca Group. Astra AB was founded in 1913 by a group of doctors and apothecaries in Södertälje, Sweden, and grew into the largest pharmaceutical company in Sweden over the 20th century.
