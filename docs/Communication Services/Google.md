## 1. What is Google?

#### 1.1 How was Google Founded?

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Initially, the search engine was called "BackRub," but it was later renamed Google, a play on the mathematical term "googol," which refers to the number 1 followed by 100 zeros.

Page and Brin met while working on a research project at Stanford, and they began developing the search engine in 1996. They used a novel approach to ranking web pages based on the number of links pointing to them, which they called PageRank. This algorithm allowed Google to provide more relevant search results than existing search engines.

The first version of Google was released on the Stanford website in August 1996, and it quickly gained popularity among Stanford insiders. Page and Brin continued to improve the service, adding full-text search and expanding the index of web pages.

In August 1998, Google incorporated and received an initial investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This investment allowed Page and Brin to leave their dorm rooms and move to a garage in Menlo Park, California, where they continued to develop the search engine.

Google's early growth was rapid, and the company went public in 2004 with an initial public offering (IPO). Since then, Google has expanded its product line to include a wide range of services, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze and Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), and more.

Today, Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., a holding company that also owns other companies such as YouTube, Waze, and Nest. Google's CEO is Sundar Pichai, who has been leading the company since 2015.
