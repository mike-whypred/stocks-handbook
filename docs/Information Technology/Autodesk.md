#### 1.3 What is the History of Autodesk?

Autodesk has a rich history that dates back to the early 1980s. The company was founded by John Walker and a group of programmer friends, and its first product was AutoCAD, an early computer-aided design (CAD) program acquired from programmer Michael Riddle.

Michael Riddle developed his first CAD program in the 1970s, but he wasn't satisfied with the result, so he started over. He worked on a 16-bit processor with 64k of addressable space, which was a significant challenge at the time. Riddle developed an innovative method of swapping parts of the problem in and out to be worked on and combined until the solution was derived. His goal was to render full photorealistic, picture-perfect scenes from floating-point models of reasonable complexity in 1/30th of a second, which was considered a ridiculous goal at the time.

AutoCAD was first released in 1982, and it quickly gained popularity among designers and engineers. The company's sales grew rapidly, and by 1989, Autodesk had become the leading provider of CAD software, with a market share of over 60%.

In the early 1990s, Autodesk launched Inventor, a new mechanical design package that was designed to be easy to use and to handle large assemblies without undue problems. The company also introduced a new data architecture called a segmented database, which allowed for faster performance and improved data management.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Autodesk continued to expand its product line and its global presence. The company launched new products, such as Autodesk Revit, which was designed for building information modeling (BIM), and Autodesk Maya, which was designed for 3D computer animation.

Today, Autodesk is a global leader in the design and engineering software industry, with a wide range of products and services that are used by millions of users around the world. The company continues to innovate and expand its product line, and it remains committed to helping its customers create better designs, improve their productivity, and reduce their costs.
