## 1. What is Nvidia?

#### 1.1 What is the History of Nvidia?

NVIDIA Corporation was founded in April 1993 by three American computer scientists: Jen-Hsun ("Jensen") Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem. The company's initial focus was on graphics-based computing and video games. The name NVIDIA is an amalgamation of two terms: "invidia," the Latin word for envy, and the acronym NV (short for "next vision"), which the company used early on to label its files.

In the early years, NVIDIA received an initial investment of $20 million in venture capital funding from firms such as Sequoia Capital, giving it the early financial support and market credibility that would lead to its initial public offering (IPO) six years later, in 1999.

NVIDIA's initial product was the NV1, a graphics accelerator optimized for processing quadratic primitives. However, Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, which only supported triangle primitives, and NVIDIA's product was not compatible. This led to a significant layoff and a focus on developing a new product, the RIVA 128, which was optimized for triangle primitives. The RIVA 128 was released in August 1997 and was a success, selling about a million units in four months.

In 1998, NVIDIA released the RIVA TNT, which solidified its reputation for developing capable graphics adapters. In 1999, the company went public and released the GeForce 256, its first product marketed as a GPU. This product introduced onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-grade hardware and was a major success.

Since then, NVIDIA has continued to innovate and expand its product line, including the development of GPU technology for artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. The company has also made significant acquisitions, including Mellanox Technologies, a leading provider of high-performance interconnect solutions.

Today, NVIDIA is a leading provider of GPU technology and is used in a wide range of applications, including gaming, professional visualization, and AI. The company has a market capitalization of over $2 trillion and is considered one of the most successful technology companies in the world.
