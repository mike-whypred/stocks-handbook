## 1. What is Microsoft?

#### 1.1 What is the History of Microsoft?

The history of Microsoft dates back to April 4, 1975, when it was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The company was initially named Micro-Soft, a portmanteau of microcomputer and software, and was registered under that name with the Secretary of State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976.

In the early days, Microsoft focused on developing software for personal computers, including the Altair 8800, which was featured on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine in January 1975. This inspired Gates and Allen to develop a BASIC language for the Altair, which they completed in February 1975 and sold to MITS, the company that manufactured the Altair.

In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to provide the operating system for IBM's first personal computer. This deal made Microsoft a significant player in the computer industry, and the company's revenues grew rapidly. In 1985, Microsoft released Windows, a graphical user interface (GUI) for personal computers, which became a huge success.

Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft continued to dominate the personal computer market, releasing new versions of Windows and Office, its popular productivity software suite. The company also expanded into new markets, including gaming and mobile phones, with the release of the Xbox console in 2001 and the Windows Mobile operating system in 2003.

In the 2000s, Microsoft faced increased competition from Google and other technology companies, and the company underwent significant changes under the leadership of CEO Steve Ballmer. In 2014, Satya Nadella took over as CEO and has since focused on cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies.

Today, Microsoft is one of the largest and most successful technology companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion and a diverse range of products and services, including Windows, Office, Azure, and Xbox.
