## 1. What is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)?

#### 1.1 What is the History and Background of AMD?

The history of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dates back to 1969 when it was founded by Jerry Sanders and seven other colleagues from Fairchild Semiconductor. Initially, AMD focused on producing microprocessors and similar computer components, licensing processor designs from other companies like Fairchild Semiconductor. In 1975, AMD created its first two non-licensed processor products, the AM2900 and AM9080, which were a series of components used to build a 4-bit modular processor and a reverse-engineered clone of Intel's 8080 8-bit microprocessor, respectively.

AMD's early success was largely due to its ability to produce high-quality products at a lower cost than its competitors. In the 1980s, AMD entered into an agreement with IBM to produce x86 processors, which helped the company gain a foothold in the market. In the 1990s, AMD began to develop its own processor designs, including the Am386 and Am486, which were competitive with Intel's processors.

In the 2000s, AMD experienced significant growth and success, thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market and the success of its Athlon and Opteron processors. However, the company faced challenges in the late 2000s and early 2010s, as it struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors.

In recent years, AMD has regained market share due to the success of its Ryzen processors, which have been competitive with Intel's processors in terms of performance and price. AMD has also expanded into new markets, such as the data center and gaming, and has acquired several companies, including ATI Technologies, to expand its product offerings.
