#### 1.3 How Does MongoDB Store Data?

MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) documents, which are essentially built on a key-value pair. Each document is stored in a collection, which is equivalent to a table in a relational database. Documents can contain various data types, including strings, integers, arrays, and other documents.

Here's a high-level overview of how MongoDB stores data:

1. **BSON Documents**: MongoDB stores data in BSON documents, which are binary representations of JSON-like data. Each document is a self-contained unit of data that can contain various data types.
2. **Collections**: Documents are stored in collections, which are equivalent to tables in a relational database. Each collection contains a set of documents.
3. **Storage**: MongoDB stores data on disk using a storage engine, such as WiredTiger. The storage engine is responsible for managing the physical storage of data on disk.
4. **Block Compression**: MongoDB uses block compression to reduce storage usage. Documents are stored on disk in compressed blocks, which are then uncompressed in memory when retrieved by the MongoDB server.
5. **Memory Storage**: MongoDB stores data in memory (RAM) for faster access and better performance. The server-side representation of a document uses BSON data types, which are automatically uncompressed in memory when retrieved.
6. **Journaling**: MongoDB uses journaling to ensure data integrity. Journaling is a process that writes data to a journal file before it is written to the main data files. This ensures that data is safely written to disk and can be recovered in case of a crash.
7. **Oplog**: MongoDB uses an oplog (operation log) to track changes to data. The oplog is a log of all changes made to the database, which is used to replicate data across nodes in a distributed database.

In terms of how MongoDB stores data on disk, it uses a combination of files and directories to store data. Each collection is stored in a separate file within the storage.dbPath for your deployment. The dbPath also includes other essential metadata files for your deployment, so a valid backup requires the full contents of your dbPath or a copy of your data via a supported MongoDB Backup Method.

In summary, MongoDB stores data in BSON documents, which are stored in collections on disk using a storage engine. The data is compressed and stored in blocks, and is automatically uncompressed in memory when retrieved. MongoDB also uses journaling and an oplog to ensure data integrity and replicate data across nodes.
