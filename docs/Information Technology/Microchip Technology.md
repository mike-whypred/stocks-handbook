## 1. What is Microchip Technology?

#### 1.1 How are Microchips Manufactured?

The manufacturing process of microchips is a complex and highly specialized process that involves several stages, from extracting silicon from sand to creating the final integrated circuit. Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:

1. **Silicon extraction**: Silicon is extracted from sand or quartz and purified to produce a high-purity single-crystal silicon ingot.
2. **Wafer production**: The ingot is then sliced into thin wafers, typically around 0.5 mm thick, using a saw.
3. **Cleaning and polishing**: The wafers are cleaned and polished to remove any impurities or defects.
4. **Layer deposition**: A non-conducting layer of silicon dioxide is grown or deposited on the surface of the wafer.
5. **Photolithography**: A photosensitive chemical called a photoresist is applied to the wafer, and then exposed to ultraviolet light through a patterned plate (mask). The areas exposed to light are hardened, while unexposed areas are etched away by hot gases.
6. **Etching**: The wafer is etched to varying depths to create the desired pattern.
7. **Doping**: The electrical conductivity of certain parts of the chip can be altered by doping them with chemicals under heat and pressure.
8. **Metal deposition**: A thin layer of metal (usually aluminum) is deposited onto the wafer to create conducting paths between the components.
9. **Etching and stripping**: The metal layer is etched and stripped to create the desired pattern.
10. **Repeat steps**: Steps 4-9 are repeated multiple times to create the desired complexity of the integrated circuit.
11. **Testing and packaging**: Each chip is tested for correct performance and then packaged in a protective casing to prevent damage.
12. **Sawing**: The wafers are sawed into individual chips, leaving a small amount of space between each chip.

The entire process is done in a "clean room" environment to prevent contamination by dust and other foreign substances. The manufacturing process is highly automated, but human intervention is still required at various stages to ensure the quality of the chips.
