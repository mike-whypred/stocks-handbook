<h2 id="1-what-is-paychex">1. What is Paychex?</h2>
<h4 id="11-what-is-the-history-and-background-of-paychex">1.1 What is the History and Background of Paychex?</h4>
<p>Paychex was founded in 1971 by B. Thomas Golisano with just $3,000 and a good idea – to make payroll outsourcing easy and affordable for small businesses. Golisano was working for a company that provided payroll services to large regional and national businesses, and he recognized that about 90 percent of U.S. businesses had only a few employees, a statistic that remains true today. He decided to start his own company to cater to these small businesses, which were being ignored by larger payroll providers.</p>
<p>Initially, Paychex had only one employee, but it quickly grew to include 18 franchises and partnerships, which were eventually consolidated into one private company in 1979. In 1983, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.</p>
<p>Over the years, Paychex has made several acquisitions, including Pay-Fone, Payday, Olsen Computer Systems, Inc., National Business Solutions, Advantage Payroll Services, Inc., InterPay Inc., and many others. The company has also developed new products and services, such as Paylink, Reportlink, and Taxpay.</p>
<p>In 2004, Golisano stepped down as CEO, and Jonathan J. Judge took over. In 2010, Martin Mucci became the CEO, and he led the company until 2022, when John Gibson took over.</p>
<p>Today, Paychex is a leading provider of human resources, payroll, and employee benefits outsourcing services for small- to medium-sized businesses. The company has more than 100 offices serving approximately 740,000 payroll clients in the U.S. and Europe. Paychex is ranked 681st on the Fortune 500 list of largest corporations by revenue.</p>
<p>Paychex has received numerous awards and honors, including being named to HR Examiner's 2020 Watchlist for the use of AI in HR, being listed as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, and being named one of the Best Places to Work in Rochester by the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.</p>
