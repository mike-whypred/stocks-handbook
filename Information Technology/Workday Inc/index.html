<h4 id="11-what-is-the-history-and-background-of-workday-inc">1.1 What is the History and Background of Workday Inc?</h4>
<p>Workday Inc. was founded in 2005 by Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri, two software visionaries who met at a diner in California. They decided to start a company that would revolutionize the enterprise software market by creating cloud-based applications for finance and HR. Duffield had previously founded PeopleSoft, a company that was acquired by Oracle in 2005, and Bhusri had held leadership positions at PeopleSoft.</p>
<p>The company's early years were marked by the development of its first application, Workday Human Capital Management, which was announced in 2006. This was followed by the beta release of Workday Financial Management in 2007, which was designed to help companies manage revenue, resources, and financial accounting.</p>
<p>In 2009, Workday hosted its first customer conference, Workday Rising, which brought together customers, partners, and employees to share best practices and exchange ideas. The company also received recognition as one of the Best Places to Work in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>By 2011, Workday had grown to over 100 customers in 46 countries, and had delivered its first unified system-of-record for both talent management and core human capital management.</p>
<p>In 2012, Workday went public with an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange, with shares jumping as much as 83% in a red-hot trading debut.</p>
<p>Since then, Workday has continued to innovate and expand its product offerings, including the launch of Workday Student in 2013, which was designed to help higher education institutions manage student and faculty lifecycle information. The company has also expanded its talent management capabilities with the introduction of Workday Recruiting in 2014.</p>
<p>Today, Workday is a leading provider of cloud-based financial management, human capital management, and student lifecycle management applications, with over 9,500 customers worldwide, including Fortune 500 companies. The company is headquartered in Pleasanton, California, and has a global presence with offices in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America.</p>
<p>Workday's mission is to help organizations manage their finances, HR, and student lifecycle information in a single, unified system that evolves as business evolves. The company's products are designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible on any device, and are built on a cloud-native architecture that provides a lower total cost of ownership and faster time to value.</p>
<p>Workday's leadership team includes Dave Duffield, Co-founder and Chairman of the Board, Aneel Bhusri, Co-founder and CEO, and other experienced executives with a background in software development, finance, and human resources. The company's values include a commitment to customer satisfaction, innovation, and social responsibility, and it has received numerous awards and recognition for its products and company culture.</p>
