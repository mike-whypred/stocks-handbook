<h2 id="1-what-is-qualcomm">1. What is Qualcomm?</h2>
<h4 id="11-what-is-the-history-and-background-of-qualcomm">1.1 What is the History and Background of Qualcomm?</h4>
<p>Qualcomm is an American global semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California, that designs, manufactures, and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and services. The company was founded in July 1985 by seven former Linkabit employees, including Irwin Jacobs, Franklin Antonio, Adelia Coffman, Andrew Cohen, Klein Gilhousen, Harvey White, and Andrew Viterbi.</p>
<p>The company's early research focused on CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) wireless cell phone technology, which was funded by selling a satellite network proposal to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Qualcomm filed its first CDMA patent in 1986 and later developed the technology for commercial use. However, the company's CDMA standard was initially rejected by the Cellular Telephone Industries Association (CTIA) in favor of the more established TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) standard.</p>
<p>Qualcomm continued to develop CDMA technology and submitted it to the CTIA again in 1989. This time, the company's CDMA standard was accepted, and it became the basis for the company's wireless products. Qualcomm's CDMA technology was used in the development of the first digital wireless network, which was launched in 1993.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Qualcomm expanded its product line to include mobile processors, modems, and other wireless products. The company also formed partnerships with other companies, such as Intel and Microsoft, to develop new wireless technologies.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, Qualcomm continued to innovate and expand its product line. The company developed the Snapdragon system-on-chip product, which includes a CPU, GPS, graphics processing unit, camera support, and other software and semiconductors. Qualcomm also acquired several companies, including VLSI Technology Organization and DFX, to expand its manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p>In the 2010s, Qualcomm continued to focus on developing new wireless technologies, including 5G. The company announced its first 5G modem chip in 2016 and demonstrated a prototype in 2017. Qualcomm also formed partnerships with other companies, such as Apple and Samsung, to develop 5G products.</p>
<p>Today, Qualcomm is one of the largest and most successful technology companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $100 billion. The company continues to innovate and expand its product line, with a focus on developing new wireless technologies and products.</p>
<p>Some of the key events in Qualcomm's history include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1985: Qualcomm is founded by seven former Linkabit employees, including Irwin Jacobs.</li>
<li>1986: Qualcomm files its first CDMA patent.</li>
<li>1989: Qualcomm's CDMA standard is accepted by the CTIA.</li>
<li>1993: The first digital wireless network is launched using Qualcomm's CDMA technology.</li>
<li>2000: Qualcomm develops the Snapdragon system-on-chip product.</li>
<li>2005: Qualcomm announces its first 4G LTE modem chip.</li>
<li>2016: Qualcomm announces its first 5G modem chip.</li>
<li>2017: Qualcomm demonstrates a 5G prototype.</li>
<li>2019: Several phones are sold with Qualcomm's 5G technology incorporated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Qualcomm's history is marked by innovation, expansion, and a focus on developing new wireless technologies and products. The company has become a leader in the technology industry and continues to shape the future of wireless communication.</p>

<h4 id="13-what-is-qualcomms-position-in-the-technology-industry">1.3 What is Qualcomm's Position in the Technology Industry?</h4>
<p>Qualcomm is a multinational corporation that specializes in creating semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. The company is headquartered in San Diego, California, and is a leading provider of wireless communication products and services.</p>
<p>Qualcomm's business is divided into three main segments:</p>
<ol>
<li>QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies): This segment focuses on CDMA wireless products, which account for approximately 80% of the company's revenue.</li>
<li>QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing): This segment grants licenses to use Qualcomm's patents, which are critical to the 5G, 4G, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, and WCDMA mobile communication standards. This segment accounts for approximately 19% of the company's revenue.</li>
<li>QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives): This segment invests in other technology companies and accounts for less than 1% of the company's revenue.</li>
</ol>
<p>Qualcomm is a fabless company, meaning that it designs and develops its products but outsources the manufacturing process to third-party companies.
