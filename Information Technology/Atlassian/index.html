<p>The company's mission and values are essential components of its strategic planning process. A mission statement defines the purpose and direction of the organization, while a values statement outlines the core principles that guide the organization's culture and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>According to the search results, a mission statement is a concise explanation of an organization's reason for existence and describes its purpose, intention, and overall objectives. It supports the vision and serves to communicate purpose and direction to employees, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a values statement lists the core principles that guide and direct the organization and its culture. It provides a moral compass for the organization and its employees, guiding decision-making and establishing a standard against which actions can be assessed.</p>
<p>The values statement is often accompanied by a code of ethics, which puts the values into practice and outlines the procedures in place to ensure the organization's values are upheld.</p>
<p>In conjunction with a values statement, a company's mission and vision statements provide direction for everything that happens in the organization. They keep everyone focused on where the organization is going and what it is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Some key takeaways from the search results include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mission statement is a simple statement about the goals, values, and objectives of an organization.</li>
<li>A values statement is a list of core principles that guide and direct the organization and its culture.</li>
<li>A code of ethics is a document that outlines the procedures in place to ensure the organization's values are upheld.</li>
<li>A strong value system and mission statement can remind you where your priorities lie and guide you to make decisions that are in line with your values.</li>
<li>A mission statement should state the purpose of what your business does and how you will do it.</li>
<li>A vision statement is your dream or ideal long-term goal that could be five to 10 years in the future.</li>
<li>Creating a mission, values, and vision makes a statement as to how a company and its personnel will interact with the consumer, its colleagues, and even competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, a company's mission and values are essential components of its strategic planning process, providing direction and guidance for all aspects of the organization.</p>
