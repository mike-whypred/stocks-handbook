<h2 id="1-what-is-apple-inc">1. What is Apple Inc?</h2>
<h4 id="11-what-is-the-history-of-apple-inc">1.1 What is the History of Apple Inc?</h4>
<p>The history of Apple Inc. dates back to April 1, 1976, when it was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in Los Altos, California. The company was initially named Apple Computer, Inc. and was founded with the intention of selling Wozniak's hand-built personal computer, the Apple I.</p>
<p>The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with a processor and some memory, intended for hobbyists. Customers had to build their own case and add their own keyboard and monitor. The Apple I was invented by Wozniak, who also hand-built every kit. Jobs handled the business end, mainly trying to convince would-be investors that the personal computer market was primed to explode.</p>
<p>In 1977, the Apple II was introduced, which was one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. The Apple II was designed to be user-friendly and was marketed as a "personal computer for the masses." It was a commercial success and helped establish Apple as a major player in the personal computer market.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Apple continued to innovate and introduce new products, including the Macintosh computer, which was the first personal computer to use a graphical user interface (GUI). However, the Macintosh was not as successful as the Apple II, and Jobs left the company in 1985.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Apple struggled to compete with Microsoft and IBM, and the company's market share declined. However, in 1997, Apple acquired NeXT Computers, a company founded by Jobs, and Jobs returned to Apple as an interim CEO. Jobs led the company's resurgence, introducing new products such as the iMac, iPod, and iPhone, which revolutionized the way people listened to music and communicated.</p>
<p>Under Jobs' leadership, Apple became one of the most successful and valuable companies in the world. In 2011, Jobs passed away, and Tim Cook took over as CEO. Under Cook's leadership, Apple has continued to innovate and introduce new products, including the Apple Watch and AirPods.</p>
<p>Today, Apple is a global technology company with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. The company is known for its innovative products and services, including the iPhone, Mac computer, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple is also a major player in the digital music and streaming markets, with its iTunes and Apple Music services.</p>
