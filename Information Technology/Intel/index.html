  <h1>Intel</h1>

<h2 id="1-what-is-intel">1. What is Intel?</h2>
<h4 id="11-what-is-the-history-of-intel">1.1 What is the History of Intel?</h4>
<p>Intel was founded on July 18, 1968, by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, along with investor Arthur Rock. The company was initially named Integrated Electronics, but was later shortened to Intel. Moore and Noyce, both pioneers in the field of semiconductor technology, had previously worked together at Fairchild Semiconductor, where they developed the first integrated circuit.</p>
<p>Intel's early products included shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits. The company grew rapidly, and by the early 1970s, it had become a leader in the DRAM, SRAM, and ROM markets.</p>
<p>In 1971, Intel introduced the world's first microprocessor, the Intel 4004. This was a significant development, as it marked the beginning of the microprocessor era. The Intel 4004 was a 4-bit processor, and it was used in a variety of applications, including calculators and computers.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Intel introduced the 8086 microprocessor, which was a 16-bit processor. This was a significant improvement over the 4004, and it paved the way for the development of more powerful microprocessors.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Intel introduced the Pentium microprocessor, which was a 32-bit processor. This was a major breakthrough, as it allowed for the development of more powerful and complex computers.</p>
<p>Today, Intel is one of the largest and most successful technology companies in the world. It is a leading manufacturer of microprocessors, and its products are used in a wide range of applications, including personal computers, servers, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Some of the key milestones in Intel's history include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1968: Intel is founded by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce.</li>
<li>1971: Intel introduces the world's first microprocessor, the Intel 4004.</li>
<li>1983: Intel introduces the 8086 microprocessor.</li>
<li>1993: Intel introduces the Pentium microprocessor.</li>
<li>2008: Intel introduces the Core i7 microprocessor.</li>
<li>2011: Intel introduces the Sandy Bridge microprocessor.</li>
<li>2015: Intel introduces the Skylake microprocessor.</li>
<li>2020: Intel introduces the Ice Lake microprocessor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intel has also been involved in a number of significant technological developments, including the development of the x86 instruction set, the creation of the first commercial microprocessor, and the development of the first 64-bit microprocessor.</p>
<h4 id="12-what-are-the-core-products-of-intel">1.2 What are the Core Products of Intel?</h4>
<p>The core products of Intel are:</p>
