<h2 id="1-what-is-biogen">1. What is Biogen?</h2>
<h4 id="11-what-is-the-history-and-background-of-biogen">1.1 What is the History and Background of Biogen?</h4>
<p>Biogen is a leading global biotechnology company that was founded in 1978 by a small group of visionary scientists, including Walter H. Gilbert, a Nobel prize-winning biologist. The company is considered one of the pioneers of the biotechnology industry and has a rich history of innovation and breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Early Years:
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva, Switzerland, and was initially focused on developing interferon alpha, a protein that could be used to treat various diseases. The company's early years were marked by significant losses, with Biogen reporting a loss of $100 million by 1984. However, the company's founders remained committed to their vision and continued to invest in research and development.</p>
<p>Mergers and Acquisitions:
In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals, and the combined company was renamed Biogen Idec. The merger brought together two companies with complementary strengths and expertise, and the combined company became one of the largest biotechnology companies in the world.</p>
<p>In 2015, Biogen Idec changed its name to Biogen, and the company has since continued to grow and expand its pipeline of potential therapies.</p>
<p>Breakthroughs and Innovations:
Biogen has a long history of innovation and breakthroughs, including the development of the first approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, nusinersen. The company has also developed a broad portfolio of medicines to treat multiple sclerosis, and has co-developed treatments to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Recent Developments:
In recent years, Biogen has made significant progress in its research and development efforts, including the approval of its drug aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The company has also made significant investments in its pipeline of potential therapies, including the acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals for nearly $6.5 billion.</p>
<p>Overall, Biogen has a rich history of innovation and breakthroughs, and continues to be a leader in the biotechnology industry. The company's commitment to its purpose of serving humanity through science has driven its growth and success, and its continued focus on innovation and research will likely shape its future.</p>
