<h4 id="13-how-does-dexcoms-technology-work">1.3 How does DexCom's Technology Work?</h4>
<p>Dexcom's technology, specifically the Dexcom G6 Pro Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system, works by using a small sensor inserted just beneath the skin to measure interstitial fluid glucose levels. The sensor is worn on the abdomen, back of the upper arm, or upper buttocks for up to 10 days. The sensor measures glucose levels every 5 minutes and sends the data wirelessly to a compatible smart device or receiver using Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The Dexcom G6 Pro system consists of several components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Applicator</strong>: A one-touch applicator allows for simple sensor insertion.</li>
<li><strong>Single-use transmitter + sensor</strong>: The disposable transmitter auto-starts for expedited startup time.</li>
<li><strong>Reader</strong>: The reader verifies session start and is for office use only. It does not display any CGM data.</li>
<li><strong>Dexcom Clarity</strong>: Using the Dexcom G6 Pro reader, you can upload patient data collected from a Dexcom G6 Pro session to Dexcom Clarity for reference during session follow-up.</li>
<li><strong>Dexcom G6 app</strong>: If prescribed for unblinded use, the patient will need to download the Dexcom G6 app (version 1.6.1 or later) for home use with their compatible smart device.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dexcom G6 Pro system provides real-time glucose data, allowing patients to make informed treatment decisions. The system also offers alerts for high and low glucose levels, as well as trend information. Patients can share their glucose data with healthcare providers or caregivers using the Dexcom Follow app.</p>
