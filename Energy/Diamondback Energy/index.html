<h4 id="11-what-is-the-history-and-background-of-diamondback-energy">1.1 What is the History and Background of Diamondback Energy?</h4>
<p>Diamondback Energy is a company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration headquartered in Midland, Texas. Here is a brief history and background of the company:</p>

<li>In March 2021, the company acquired QEP Resources.</li>
<li>In February 2024, the company was reported to be in final discussions toward a merger with Endeavor Energy Resources that would create an oil-and-gas giant worth more than $50 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diamondback Energy is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FANG.</li>
