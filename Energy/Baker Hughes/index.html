<h2 id="1-what-is-baker-hughes">1. What is Baker Hughes?</h2>
<h4 id="11-what-is-the-history-and-background-of-baker-hughes">1.1 What is the History and Background of Baker Hughes?</h4>
<p>Baker Hughes is a leading energy technology company that designs and manufactures transformative technologies that take energy forward. The company has a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The story of Baker Hughes began in the early 20th century when two young men, R.C. Baker and H.R. Hughes, Sr., set out to make their fortunes in the booming new oilfields of California and Texas. Initially, they worked as wildcatters, but they achieved lasting success through technical innovations that would improve operations for the entire industry.</p>
<p>In 1907, R.C. Baker received a patent on a casing shoe that revolutionized well cementing and thus launched Baker Oil Tools. In 1909, H.R. Hughes, Sr. patented a roller cone bit that made it possible to drill through deeper, harder rock. This invention gave birth to the Hughes Tool Company.</p>
<p>Over the years, both companies grew and expanded, with Baker Oil Tools becoming a leading provider of oilfield services and Hughes Tool Company becoming a major manufacturer of drilling equipment. In the 1980s, the two companies suffered financial slumps, leading to their turbulent but successful consolidation in 1987.</p>
<p>The merged company, Baker Hughes Incorporated, became a global leader in oilfield services, providing a wide range of products and services to the world petroleum and continuous process industries. The company's core values include integrity, teamwork, and performance, and it has continued to innovate and expand its operations over the years.</p>
<p>Today, Baker Hughes is a global company with operations in over 100 countries and a diverse range of products and services that include production and completion equipment, electrical submersible pumps, drill bits, drilling systems, specialty chemicals, and more. The company is committed to helping the world meet its growing need for energy while also promoting sustainability and reducing its environmental impact.</p>
<p>Some notable milestones in the history of Baker Hughes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1907: R.C. Baker receives a patent on a casing shoe that revolutionizes well cementing and launches Baker Oil Tools.</li>
<li>1909: H.R. Hughes, Sr. patents a roller cone bit that makes it possible to drill through deeper, harder rock and gives birth to the Hughes Tool Company.</li>
<li>1987: Baker Oil Tools and Hughes Tool Company merge to form Baker Hughes Incorporated.</li>
<li>2006: Baker Hughes Incorporated is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol BHI.</li>
<li>2017: Baker Hughes is acquired by GE (General Electric) and becomes a subsidiary of the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Baker Hughes has a rich history that spans over a century, and it continues to be a leading player in the energy industry today.</p>
